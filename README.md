# azure-cloud-resume

## Summary
This project is based on the callenge of called "The Cloud Resume Challenge Book" written by Forrest Brazeal. It consist on a series of guided steps to build an html-based resum√© and deploy it on several Cloud providers (Azure in my case).

This project lets you gain hands-on experience. This book works as a guide and not as a tutorial, thing which I like because it forces you to deepdive into docs.

Thanks to this project you will practice:
1. Azure CDN.
2. Azure Storage Accounts.
3. Azure Custom domains.
4. Azure functions.
5. DevOps practices.
6. Html, CSS and JS.
7. Terraform (or other IaC solutions).
8. Python. 

My goal writting this doc is to motivate other people that, like me, wanted to change their career paths into Cloud Computing.
